<h1>Introduction </h1>

Here's a recent biography I used for the Pratt InfoShow last semester.<br><Br>
I'm a researcher, policy analyst and expert in intersectional feminist frameworks. As both a qualitative and quantitative researcher, the most enjoyable projects are those that involve surveys and questionnaires - I love designing questions that elicit insightful answers. I am a polymath with initiative and curiosity. I received my M.A. in International Affairs from The New School in 2016 and am pursuing my M.S. in Data Analytics and Visualization (DAV) from the Pratt School of Information, which I'm anticipating to complete in Spring 2022. My ultimate goals are to become a leader in feminist applications of DAV, and to empower women and LGBTQI+ activists through it. For most of the world, data is ubiquitous, yet latent. I want to make it kinetic energy for peace.
